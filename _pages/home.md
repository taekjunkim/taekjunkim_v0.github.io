## About me
Iâ€™m Taekjun, a neuroscientist studying how visual information is encoded, transmitted in the brain to create a unified representation of the visual scene.
My experimental approaches include neurophysiological recordings, computational modeling and human psychophysics. 

In my doctoral studies at the University of California, Berkeley, I focused on deciphering the functions of three key cortical connections in vision. Through carefully designed experiments in the primary visual cortex, I analyzed neuronal activity using visual and magnetic stimulation to elicit weighted responses from feedforward, feedback, and horizontal connections. This exploration provided insights into the basic principles of how early visual processing shapes our perception of the world.

As a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Washington, I've expanded my focus to delve into higher-level vision processes aligned with visual perception. This shift involves exploring diverse domains such as object boundary/surface perception, visual crowding, and motion processing. Additionally, I have a keen interest in investigating brain interactions through cortical inactivation techniques and analyzing neuronal population data using high-density recording tools like Neuropixels and multi-photon imaging.
