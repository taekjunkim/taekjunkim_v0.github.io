This post has a custom sidebar set in the post's YAML Front Matter.

An example of how that YAML could look is:

```yaml
sidebar:
  - title: "Title"
    image: "/assets/images/your-image.jpg"
    image_alt: "image"
    text: "Some text here."
  - title: "Another Title"
    text: "More text here."
    nav: sidebar-sample
```


## Machine learning
- Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed

## Machine learning algorithms
- Supervised learning
- Unsupervised learning
- Recommender systems
- Reinforcement learning

## Supervised learning
- Learns from being given "right answers"
	- Example applications: spam filtering, speech recognition, machine translation, etc
- Regression: Housing price prediction
	- predicts a number
	- predict infinitely many possible outcomes
- Classification: Breast cancer detection
	- predict categories, small sets of possible outcomes

## Unsupervised learning
- Find something interesting in unlabeled data
	- Has to find structure in the data
- Clustering: group similar data points together
- Anomaly detection: find unusual data points
- Dimensionality reduction: compress data using fewer numbers
