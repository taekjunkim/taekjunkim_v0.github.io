## What is the neural code

- techniques for recording from the brain
- tools for discovering how the brain represents information
- models that express our understanding of the representation
- some models for inferring what the brain is doing based on its activity
- using information theory to quantify neural representation
- the biological basis of how the brain processes inputs and performs complex computations

## Encoding and decoding

- encoding: how does a stimulus cause a pattern of responses
  - building quasi-mechanistic models
  - $$P(response|stimulus)$$.
- decoding: what do these responses tell us about the stimulus
  - how can we reconstruct what the brain is doing?
  - $$P(stimulus|response)$$

## Basic coding model

- temporal filtering
  - Linear filter: $$r(t) = \sum^{n}_{k=0}s_{t-k}f_{k} = \int^{t}_{\infty}d{\tau}\ s(t-\tau)\ f(\tau)$$
- spatial filtering
  - Linear filter: $$r(t) = \sum^{n}_{x'=-n,y'=-n}s_{x-x',y-y'}f_{x',y'} = \int^{t}_{\infty}dx'\ dy' s(x-x',y-y')\ f(x',y')$$
- spatiotemporal filtering
  - Linear filter: $$r_{x,y}(t) = \int \int \int dx' \ dy' \ d\tau \ f(x',y',\tau) \ s(x-x',y-y',t-\tau)$$
- Linaer filter and nonlinearity: $$r(t) = g(\int \ s(t-\tau) \ f(\tau) \ d\tau)$$
