#### 1. Bar graph <br>
A graph that shows the frequency or amount of a variable as a function of the length of the bars. It's the most basic data visualization design. A characteristic of bar graphs is that they deal with discrete data. As such, they are characterized by a gap between each bar.

#### 2. Histogram <br>
A histogram is a representation of the frequency of bins for a particular variable. You can think of it as a scatterplot represented by bars. Histograms differ from [[bar graphs]] in that they deal with continuous data.

#### 3. Pie chart <br>
A data visualization design that represents the proportions of categories that make up a group of data. It is expressed using area, dividing a circle as if it were a pie. It mainly represents percentages. If you want to show subcategories of a category within a group of data, you can apply it as a rose chart.

#### 4. Line graph <br>
A graph that represents data as points in two dimensions and connects them with line segments. It is a data visualization design that is convenient for tracking changes over time and has the advantage of inferring the median value of the data. Line graphs are commonly used to represent precipitation, temperature changes, etc.

#### 5. Box plot <br>
A data visualization design that allows you to simultaneously compare the distribution and outliers of your data with other data sets. The box represents the range in which 50% of the data (25 to 75 percentile) is distributed, and the whiskers represent the range containing the minimum and maximum values. 

#### 6. Scatter plot <br>
A data visualization design for determining the correlation between two variables. The intersection of the x-axis and y-axis is plotted on a diagram, and the shape of the points reveals direction and strength. 

#### 7. Mosaic plot <br>
A data visualization design used to show the relationship between two or more categorical data points. The lengths of the two axes represent the values of each variable, creating a ratio. <br>

#### 8. Treemap chart <br>
A treemap chart is created using a data visualization technique that visualizes hierarchical data in the form of nested rectangles. The tree-like structure uses rectangles of decreasing sizes, hence called “nesting.” The data in a treemap chart is organized using rectangles. The plot colors and dimensions of the rectangles are calculated in accordance with the quantities variables. <br>

#### 9. Heatmap <br>
Heatmaps visualise data through variations in colouring. When applied to a tabular format, Heatmaps are useful for cross-examining multivariate data, through placing variables in the rows and columns and colouring the cells within the table. Heatmaps are good for showing variance across multiple variables, revealing any patterns, displaying whether any variables are similar to each other, and for detecting if any correlations exist. <br>
