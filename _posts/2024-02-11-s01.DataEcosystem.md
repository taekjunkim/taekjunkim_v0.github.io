## The value we derive form data depends on

- Accuracy of data
- Accessibility of data when we need it

## Modern data ecosystem

- Data sources
  - Structured and Unstructured
  - Pull a copy of the data from the original sources into a data repository
- Enterprise data environment
  - Raw data needs to get organized, cleaned up, optimized for access, and conform to compliances and standards enforced in the organization
  - Data integrated from disparate sources
  - Different types of analysis and skills to generate insights
  - Active stakeholders to collaborate and act on insights generated
  - Tools, applications, and infrastructure to store, process, and disseminate data as required
- Users

## Roles of players in the data ecosystem

- Data engineering convert raw data into usable data
- Data analytics use this data to generate insights
- Data scientists use data analytics and data engineering to predict the future using data from the past
- Business analysts and business intelligence analysts use these insights and predictions to derive decisions that benefit and grow their business

## The field of data engineering

- Collecting source data
  - extracting, integrating, and organizing data from disparate sources
    - data acquisition from multiple sources
    - data architecture for storing source data
- Processing data
  - cleaning, transforming, and preparing data to make it usable
    - distributed systems for processing data
    - pipelines for extracting, transforming, and loading data
    - solutions for safeguarding quality, privacy, and security of data
    - performance optimization
    - adherence to compliance guidelines
- Storing data
  - storing data for reliability and easy availability of data
    - data stores for storage of processed data
    - scalable systems
    - ensuring data privacy, security, compliance, monitoring, backup, and recovery
- Making data available to users securely
  - APIs, services, and programs for retrieving data for end-users
  - User access through interfaces and dashboards
  - Checks and balances to ensure data security
