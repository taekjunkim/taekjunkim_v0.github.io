## Machine learning
- Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed

## Machine learning algorithms
- Supervised learning
- Unsupervised learning
- Recommender systems
- Reinforcement learning

## Supervised learning
- Learns from being given "right answers"
	- Example applications: spam filtering, speech recognition, machine translation, etc
- Regression: Housing price prediction
	- predicts a number
	- predict infinitely many possible outcomes
- Classification: Breast cancer detection
	- predict categories, small sets of possible outcomes

## Unsupervised learning
- Find something interesting in unlabeled data
	- Has to find structure in the data
- Clustering: group similar data points together
- Anomaly detection: find unusual data points
- Dimensionality reduction: compress data using fewer numbers
