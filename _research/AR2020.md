## Abstract
<Font size = "3"> Area V4—the focus of this review—is a mid-level processing stage along the ventral visual pathway of the macaque monkey. V4 is extensively interconnected with other visual cortical areas along the ventral and dorsal visual streams, with frontal cortical areas, and with several subcortical structures. Thus, it is well poised to play a broad and integrative role in visual perception and recognition—the functional domain of the ventral pathway. Neurophysiological studies in monkeys engaged in passive fixation and behavioral tasks suggest that V4 responses are dictated by tuning in a high-dimensional stimulus space defined by form, texture, color, depth, and other attributes of visual stimuli. This high-dimensional tuning may underlie the development of object-based representations in the visual cortex that are critical for tracking, recognizing, and interacting with objects. Neurophysiological and lesion studies also suggest that V4 responses are important for guiding perceptual decisions and higher-order behavior. </Font>
